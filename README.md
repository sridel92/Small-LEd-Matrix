# Small-LEd-Matrix
a very small led matrix with arduino mini



Led Matrix is a Led LD788BS-SS22 8x8  (About 20 x 20 mm without controller)

the wiring is not esaing and each wire a "charlie's plexing"

a very smal animation is embedded in code

I have also design a little box for Arduino mini, usb connector and matrix.
keep in mind the usb only provide 5v and can't upload the code.
You need to have an serial adapter to do that (arduino mini have only tx rx pin)

Enjoy
