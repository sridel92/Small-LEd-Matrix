# Small-LEd-Matrix
A very small led matrix with arduino mini

Led Matrix is a Led LD788BS-SS22 8x8  (About 20 x 20 mm without controller)

The wiring is not easing and each wire a "charlie's multiplexing".

A very smal animation is embedded in code

I have also design a little box for Arduino mini, usb connector and matrix.
keep in mind the usb only provide 5v and can't upload the code.
You need to have an serial adapter to do that (arduino mini have only tx rx pin)

3D files for the box are here :
